    "# Optimal Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary way through which a bank makes money is a loan. The bank will lend you some sum of money which you then must pay back over the duration of the loan period, plus some interest. However, sometimes individuals may not be able to pay back their loan, causing them to default. Choosing who gets a loan is then a pivotal component of a bank's profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will try to automate this process using a scoring function with a minimum threshold. We will design a profit maximizing algorithm using a sampling based approach, analyze its performance, and investigate its demographic impact. Although our model is profitable, ultimately we find that thresholded linear scoring methods can struggle to attain a high degree of accuracy, and hence profitability. We also find that input features to the model can result in a vicious cycle of discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by taking a look at the data. First, let's see what type of people are defaulting on their loans. While there are many features in the data frame that we might use to extrapolate on demographic information, there are three of interest. First, is loan intent, which is subdivided into Venture, Education, Medical, Home Improvement, Personal, and Debt Consolidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {#loan-intent layout-ncol=2}\n",
    "\n",
    "![Repaid](media/IntentBreakDownRepaidLoans-SORTED.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Deafulted](media/IntentBreakDownDefaultedLoans-SORTED.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Loan Intent by Loan Status\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a chi square test on the data returns Chi Square Statistic of approximately 368 with confidence value approaching 0. Clearly, whether or not someone defaults on their loans impacts the distribution of loan intent. However, a quick look at the charts reveals that the per-category difference is plus/minus a few percent. For our purposes, this does not indicate a clear bias, and we may confirm this in the correlation matrix: Indeed, the correlation between loan status and loan intent is .09. However, this information will be useful when assessing algorithm performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll take a look at loan amount subdivided by defaults. This will be particularly useful when assessing algorithm profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](media/DefaultRepayAmnt.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick glance at the histogram shows that amount seems to have a negligible impact on defaults. Again, we may confirm this in the correlation matrix: loan amount has a .1 positive correlation with defaults. Finally, let's look at home ownership. This is subdivided into those with mortgages, full home ownership, renters, and another category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {#homeownership-loanstatus layout-ncol=2}\n",
    "\n",
    "![Repaid](media/HomeOwnershipRepaidLoans-SORTED.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Deafulted](media/HomeOwnershipDefaultedLoans-SORTED.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, Renters comprise about 73% of individuals who defaulted on their loans but only 44% of those who repay them. We also see that, combined, home owners and individuals with mortgages make up about 26% of individuals who default, but 55% of individuals who repay their loans. We'll also run a Chi Square Test on this feature, which results in a Chi-square statistic of approximately 1294 with confidence 2.913582391497053e-280! This makes qualitative sense: Individuals that own property are more likely to own assets, and be able to leverage said assets (home, financial, or otherwise) to repay loans. Homeownership also has a positive .22 correlation with loan status.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Selection and Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two clear candidate features to train on the model: Loan Percent of Income and Default on File. If one takes out a loan that is a greater percent of yearly income, it can be hard for them to pay it back along with other expenses. Moreover, if one defaults on their loan for some reason, we can assume that they are likely to do it again in the future. These features have positive correlation with loan status of .38 and .14 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our initial exploration, we also found that home ownership impacts loan repayment. How does it stack up against the loan's percent of an individual's income? For convenience analysis, call a loan amount that is greater than 50% of one's income  \"high risk\" and the converse \"low risk\". We can then subdivide our dataset into high risk loans and low risk, and look at the frequency of homeownership type in each.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {#homeownership-loanstatus layout-ncol=2}\n",
    "\n",
    "![Low Risk](media/loanPercentHomeownershipGOOD.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "![High Risk](media/loanPercentHomeownershipBAD.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Homeownership Breakdown For Repaid and Defaulted Loans\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that renters make up a larger portion of high risk loans. This observation lends some insight to our initial finding: Perhaps renters may also be more likely to default on their loans since they are more likely to take out loans that are a higher percent of their income.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our model, we use logistic regression, and we'll train on the features discussed (.e.g Loan Percent Income, Default on File, and Homeownership Type). This yields an accuracy of 84% on the testing data--well within industry standards and acceptable for a simple regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Profit Optmization\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the fun begins. First, let's define a simple profit model for the bank. If an individual is able to repay their loan, let's assume they\n",
    "did so over a 10 year period. On the other hand, if an individual defaults on their loan, we'll assume that this occurred after a 3 year period.\n",
    "We'll also assume that the bank's operating cost is 75% of the loan profit, to add some spice to our data (we don't want to make things too easy).\n",
    "This leads to the following equations. Let $R$ be the value of a repaid loan, $D$ the value of a defaulted loan, $P$ the principle, and $I$ the decimal interest rate. Then we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R = P \\cdot (1 + I)^{10} - P $$\n",
    "$$D = P \\cdot (1 + I)^3 - P$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use these equations to create a profit and loss column -- denoted PnL --in both our training and testing data. We can do this as follows:"

Notice that $n \\cdot k < D \\Longrightarrow n \\cdot k \\cdot \\Delta < D \\cdot \\Delta$, we can theoretically accomplish this more quickly then the aforementioned method. This method is also quite empirically accurate at threshold determination for $n,k$ small. This is accomplished with the following functions:"

Our model has an accuracy of around 84%. The theoretical PnL is $12634399.24, the Model PnL is $7476722.014, and the Thresholded PnL is $7850920.35. Here Model PnL is the profit and loss if we use the model's threshold. The Thresholded PnL is the profit and loss if we use our threshold. Using the thresholded PnL produces a 5% increase in profitability. However, both predictive methods capture just north of 60% of potential profits. While profit is not a linear function of accuracy, if we assigned loan amounts reflective of the population to the 80% of the data we predicted correctly, we might expect it to be closer to 80% of theoretical profits. This observation suggests two, not-necessarily-mutually-exclusive possibilities. First, the algorithm is not giving loans to high value loans. This would mean that we are leaving gainz on the table. Second, the algorithm is giving high value loans to people who are defaulting, which would put a downward pressure on profit. Let's investigate.\n",

In that sense, this is a question of model selection rather than optimization.
